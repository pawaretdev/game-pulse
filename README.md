A small Windows tray app that watches your game clients and alerts your phone the moment one disconnects, so you can leave characters logged in overnight and still sleep.

- Supported game: **Ragnarok Origin Classic** (`rooc.exe`). Watch several games at once from the library
- Alerts through **ntfy**, a **Discord** webhook or a **Telegram** bot, and repeats until the client is back
- Never reads game memory, clicks anything or touches your account
- Keeps watching from the system tray when you close the window

## Getting started

1. Download `gamepulse-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/pawaretdev/game-pulse/releases/latest) and unzip it into a folder you will keep. There is no installer.
2. Run **`gamepulse.exe`**. If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC" (the file isn't code-signed), click **More info › Run anyway**.
3. Follow the 4-step setup: pick an alert channel, send a test to your phone, make your phone wake you up, and choose whether to start with Windows.
4. Before you sleep, run **Settings › Test your setup › Run drill** once. It proves the alerts wake you, not just that they arrive.
5. Leave it running. Closing the window hides it to the tray.

Also set Windows **Power & sleep** to **Never**, or the PC sleeps and the game and monitor stop together.
